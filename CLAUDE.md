- `python -m venv venv` - Create virtual environment
- `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows) - Activate virtual environment
- `pip install -r requirements.txt` - Install dependencies
- `python -m pytest` - Run tests
- `python -m flake8` or `python -m black` - Code formatting/linting

## Architecture Notes

The project structure and architecture will be documented here as the codebase develops.
